                <p>
                    Hello!<br><br>
                    My name is Yvanna Cardenas Beltran. <br>
                    I am a Computer Science student currently enrolled at the University of California, San Diego, class of June 2026. I’m driven into technology because of the urge to solve problems, teamwork, and developing functional solutions that offer a voice to the community.
                    <br><br>
                    With a strong foundation in software development, I have further strengthened my skills with courses in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Computer Architecture, besides real-world projects. For instance, I created a space-themed, interactive Developer Journal web app for users to organize tasks and reflect on their development and also an entertainment recommender app built with Flask, AWS, and OpenAI that enhances decision-making. These have deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my ability to deliver user-centered solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond coding, I thrive in environments that are truly collaborative, where ideas are shared, challenges faced as a team, and innovation is made alive. I pride myself on my communication, empathy, and the positivity I can add to any team. To me, strong relationships and a people-first approach are as crucial to success as technical skills.
                    <br><br>
                    I am passionate about using technology for creating impact. Whether through tools to improve everyday living or systems that attempt to solve critical challenges, I aim to build solutions with impact. Always keen to learn and grow in projects that espouse innovation, inclusivity, and community, my values are in alignment with what drives this movement.

                <h2>Some Hobbies!</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of software engineering, I strive to be a well-rounded person with a mix of creative and mindful pursuits. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast (some might say snob), I love exploring different brewing methods and discovering new roasts. Music is another passion of mine—I enjoy collecting vinyl records and curating playlists for any mood or occasion. Journaling helps me reflect and stay organized, while hot yoga keeps me grounded and active. These interests not only bring me joy but also shape my approach to problem-solving, creativity, and balance in both my personal and professional life. 
                    <br><br>Below are a few of my playlists.
