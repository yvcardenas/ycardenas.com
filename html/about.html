                <p>
                My name is Yvanna Cardenas Beltran. I am a computer science student
                enrolled in the University of California, San Diego, class of June 2026. I seek
                technology skills because of my urge to solve problems, work well in a team,
                and develop functional solutions that offer a voice to the community. <br><br>

                I have a strong foundation in software development. And I have further
                strengthened my skills with courses in data structures, algorithms, computer
                architecture, and real-world projects. For instance, I created a space-themed,
                interactive Developer Journal web app for users to organize tasks and reflect
                on their development. I also built an entertainment recommender app with
                Flask, AWS, and OpenAI to enhance decision-making. These projects have
                deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my ability to deliver user-
                centered solutions.<br><br>

                Beyond coding, I thrive in genuinely collaborative environments where we
                share ideas, face challenges as a team, and innovation is made alive. I pride
                myself on my communication, empathy, and the positivity I can add to any
                team. I provide strong relationships and a people-first approach, which are as
                crucial to success as technical skills.<br><br>

                I am passionate about using technology to create impact. Whether through
                tools to improve everyday living or systems that attempt to solve critical
                challenges, I aim to build impactful solutions. Iâ€™m always keen to learn and
                grow in projects that espouse innovation, inclusivity, and community. My
                values align with those values.

                <h2>Some Hobbies!</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of software engineering, I strive to be a well-rounded person with a mix of creative and mindful pursuits. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast (some might say snob), I love exploring different brewing methods and discovering new roasts. Music is another passion of mineâ€”I enjoy collecting vinyl records and curating playlists for any mood or occasion. Journaling helps me reflect and stay organized, while hot yoga keeps me grounded and active. These interests not only bring me joy but also shape my approach to problem-solving, creativity, and balance in both my personal and professional life. 
                    <br><br>Below are a few of my playlists.
